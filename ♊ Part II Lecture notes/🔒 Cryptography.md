        - How does the Diffie-Hellman protocol work? ‚Üì 
            - Alice and Bob know of 3 large public numbers $p, q,g$. 
            - Alice and Bob both choose secret numbers $x$ and $y$ respectively. Where $0 < x < q , \ \  \ 0 < y < q$  
            - Then A ‚áí B:
$$PK_a = g^x \mod g$$
And B ‚áí A:
$$PK_b = g^y \mod p$$
These act as the public keys.
            - Both Alice and bob know that:
$$K = (g^y \ \mathrm{mod}\ p ) ^ x \ \mathrm{mod}\  p = (g^x \ \mathrm{mod}\ p ) ^ y \ \mathrm{mod}\ p$$
So they can calculate those independently with their secret keys and use the result a secret key between the two of them.
        - Private keys are symmetric keys while public/secret key pairs is asymmetric.
        - Ephemeral/session keys are only used briefly and are usually generated fresh for each communication session.
        - Static keys stay the same for months/years - generally part of a signed certificate wherein a trusted third party certifies the public key.
        - Master keys are used to generate other derived keys.
    - When is a cryptographic scheme secure?

            - What is the defining Kerhoff principle?‚Üí __The system must not require secrecy and can be stolen by the enemy without causing trouble__ .
E.g. even if the way our protocol works is leaked, there's nothing you can do [üòù](../üòù.md) 
    - Message length
        - Why does message length pose a problem for encryption?‚ÜíWe always assume messages have a fixed length m - but note **a longer message will generate a longer cipher-text**. This is hard to hide & does provide some information - we can tell the difference between a tweet and an essay. File lengths alone can uniquely identify which website you've travelled to.
        - Why does compression cause a problem for encryption?‚ÜíCompression can leak information - it gives us a relationship between the content and the **resulting size **of the output. For example, if I append my password to a known form and it's compressed - all we need to do is iterate over many text+password compressing until we find what we want. 
    - Historic Ciphers
        - Shift ciphers, i.e. Caesar Cipher. K=13 is rot 13
    - Transposition Cipher
        - K is some permutation of the letter position - the key space is n! where n is the permutation block length.
![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/ePP7yAtBU-AaagBx5MhREuOHbI0ZD9_7ic2COfRG3C0fxnpLPyD0cFsSdezUGq7AOaktmyR8xB8phpErSboIGhzUhaAkObft9NgkPE0EOTCmDlplXcMYZHBvqq3um3-D.png)
        - If you have a black box transposition cipher where you can feed in strings and get output. If we have $\log_a(n)$ slots and an alphabet of size $a$ it would take you $\log_n(a)$ tries.
We just give each different position different letters.
    - Substitution Cipher
        - Key is permutation - swap one key for another

        - How can you break a Vigenere cipher given an encrypted message?‚Üì ‚Üì 
            - We will split the message into separate messages $M_1M_2...M_l$ encrypted by cipher texts $C_1C_2...C_l$. 
So first we must find the key length $l$.  
            - Take a guess at the key length and examine the letter frequency of each message $M$. 
            - Form a letter frequency histogram **from each group**. I.e. How many S's in group 1, group 2... group l.
If the letter frequency histograms are as they would be for your target language (except rotated) you've guessed right.
If not then the letter frequency histograms will be flatter (with less pronounced peaks!) as they are the combination of multiple rotated letter frequency histograms.
            - To decide if a histogram is flat or not you calculate the **index of coincidence **that is:$$IC(C_i) = \sum_{a\in A} p^2_{a,i}$$
 This is **minimal **if the probability of each letter is 1/26 (or one over the alphabet size). And is increased when peaks are present. This is also the probability that two randomly chosen letters from $C_i$ are identical.
            - Finally, pick the key length $l$ that leads to the highest $\frac{1}{l} IC(C_i)$ 
            - Finally, we have a monoalphabetic shift cipher - just use the language statistics.
If we don't know the language, we can look at the difference between the peaks in the histogram to find the difference between two consecutive letters. Then brute force.
    - Perfect secrecy
        - What is computational security‚ÜíIf the most efficient algorithm for breaking a cipher would take more time than possible to perform.
        - What is Unconditional security‚ÜíAdversaries do not have enough information to decide from the cipher-text if one plain-text is more likely to be correct than the other.
Even with unlimited computation.
        - Consider a private-key encryption function with an encryption function and a decryption function:
$$\text{Enc: } \mathcal{K} \times \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}, \ \ \text{Dec: } \mathcal{K} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$$

Where the decryption function is simply the inverse of the decryption function.
        - Let  $\mathbb{P}(M)$, $\mathbb{P}(K)$ be the adversary's a-priori knowledge of the probability that the plaintext M or key K is used. 
        - The adversary can then calculate the probability of **any **ciphertext $C$ as:
$$\mathbb{P}(C) = \sum_{K \in \mathcal{K}} \mathbb{P}(K) \cdot \mathbb{P}(\text{Dec}_K(C))$$
I.e. iterate over **all **the possible keys and find the probability of that key **and **the message. 
I.e. generate a key, and see if the result looks like an actual plaintext message.
Note $\mathbb{P}(\text{Dec}_K(C))$ = $\mathbb{P}(M_K)$, E.g. the message for that decoding key:
$$\mathbb{P}(C) = \sum_{K \in \mathcal{K}} \mathbb{P}(K) \cdot \mathbb{P}(M_K)$$ 
        - And can also determine the conditional probability:
$$\mathbb{P}(C|M) = \sum _{\{K \in \mathcal{K} | M = \text{Dec}_K(C)\}} \mathbb{P}(K)$$
Iterate over **only **those keys which give the plaintext M. Then find the probability that all those corresponding keys could have been chosen.
        - The adversary can then find the probability of the **plaintext **given the **ciphertext:
** ![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/DqSsn8LPOAmzgimlbBd4rY4jNiWGExH9GC5En-pJiF7JNJJ9IC6I0jvq8FRg0RctuVgeodc1nqoPpTxn84-ZzWLhgKLNSFUEF8J_KzImqHgE32rP2c-fQcWem5DiaBvn.png) 
        - What is the definition of perfect secrecy?‚ÜíIf for every probability distribution over $\mathcal{M}$ and every message $M \in \mathcal{M}$, and every ciphertext - with $\mathbb{P}(C)>0$ we have $$\mathbb{P}(M|C) = \mathbb{P}(M)$$
I.e. a ciphertext tells you **nothing **about the probability of a message - you get no new information. 
    - One time pads
        - Shannons theorem:
![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/lBz6ZldQDTmEzf1SZa9HHZJouQjbdIi76quQ4GB82P-U3IsAD2yW_s-3nFR3vonaOMgBEgAHYiR7gpMvxjvorkORcoWekfvDnv4XMbJDnMBsWBUPN0Z-mWtBeh_NMIux.png) 
        - What does Shannon's theorem? (Hint: it's about perfect secrecy)‚ÜíA encryption scheme is perfectly secret **if and only if:
**$|\mathcal{M}| = |\mathcal{K}| = |\mathcal{C}|$ (I.e. the size of the sets of messages, keys and ciphertexts is the same). 
 ‚áí The generator chooses every K with equal probability.
 ‚áí For every message and every ciphertext there exists a **unique **key such that $C = \text{Enc}_K M$ 
I.e. for **every message **there are millions of keys which would encrypt that message to the same ciphertext (and they're all of the same probability). So the message could be a plot to destroy the world or a shopping list. 
        - The classic example is the one time pad:
![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/bBWjIVZtIDz8Ts2lfgiuqi8CYGSY7dD_XToSPDtHeJDLxTuBru_PoGtP2RwISARypa59wf0YBFxBnA3eqNKcIIVdzNRsP2QjU2f8tZyS9mjw9WhbePSW89whzV4obY7R.png) 
        - What is the one time pad‚ÜíA method of perfect secrecy where we uniformly randomly choose a binary key (with the same length as the message)  and encrypt our binary message via: $K \otimes M$ . Decrypt the same way.
There are millions of messages and key combinations which would give the same ciphertext.
        - Note that if x is a random bit with **any **probability distribution and y is a bit with a uniform 50/50 distribution. $x \otimes y$ will have **uniform probability! **This also works for addition modulo $m$ or **any finite group.** 
        - The problem with one time pads is that one bit is necessary for **each **message bit! This is hard to safely courier around. 
    - Random number generators
        - An idea would be to send a shorter key, and use that as a seed value for a random number generator. Split the message M into chunks as long as the random number generator and then XOR as usual?

    - Private key encryption schemes
        - A **private-key encryption scheme **is a tuple of random generetor, encryptor and decryptor it contains: 
            - The **key generation algorithm **which receives a security parameter L and outputs a key. Note that the $|K| \ge l$ - this security parameter controls how long the key is. 
            - **Encryption algo **maps the key and a plaintext to a ciphertext 
            - The **decryption algorithm **just does the inverse. 
        - What is a negligible function?‚ÜíA function that $f : \N \rightarrow \R_{\ge 0}$ (outputs more than zero) which as n increases, gets arbitrarily close to zero faster than the inverse of any polynomial. I.e. Could be inverse exponential.

As for shift ciphers, given a ciphertext and a message there is **one **unique key which turns a given message into a given ciphertext.  
    - So we have: $$P(M|C) = \frac{P(M) \cdot \frac{1}{26}}{\sum_K \frac{1}{26} \cdot P(\text{Dec}_K(C))} = \frac{P(M)}{\sum_K P(\text{Dec}_K(C))}$$ 
    - We then note that the sum of the probabilities of each message is simply 1.
$$\sum_K \text{Dec}_K(C) = 1$$  
    - $$P(M|C) = \frac{P(M)}{1} = P(M)$$

What's the problem with this?‚Üì ‚Üì 
            - We feed the pseudo-random generator $n$ bits, so it can only have $2^n$ possible outputs. Then we divide by all the possible strings that the **expanded **bits can produce (which we will brute force search will look through). 
Therefore, the second line gives the **probability **the distinguisher misfires and thinks a random string is pseudo-randomly generated.  
            - The distinguisher needs to be polynomial - this is an exponential algorithm.

            - This method of encryption has "indistinguishable encryption in the presence of an eavesdropper" assuming G is a psudo-random generator.
        - What are stream ciphers?‚ÜíWe generate a random key, then use a pseudo-random generator with that key as input to generate a random string. This string is then XOR'd with our message to get the ciphertext.  
![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/yTW6JKIveJiw-2XT1DE-uf95LkLpQ-KoU2Yb8XS6URPoawkxcqUivhG2H7wq66DLpyI9t5uT-Um6b9Kc_aaRUy9TpXWwBKhe5558UxM3OIp_PrdJCTUrI6ng7p14bkHi.png)
        - How could we prove that a **stream cipher **has indistinguishable encryption in the presence of an eavesdropper? (Assuming it uses a pseudo-random generator)‚ÜíOur stream cipher is encrypted using a pseudo random generator - Assume some decryptor for the cipher exists.
This decryptor could be used to distinguish messages from the pseudo-random generator - but this violates our assumption.
**Note: **These would all have to be polynomial time also.
        - Proving stream ciphers work
            - Claiming indistinguishability in the presence of an eavesdropper if G is a pseudo-random generator.
            - If $\Pi_\text{PRG}$ did not have I.P.E (indistinguishably...) then there would be an adversary for which:
![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/MaIkMWca0C3NR3UGn3sfElwpr02hDVTZVY-Ej8elvuMFfC0er_N6C8yt0e-v14zVzrN73OGfyQRXuX9CKyZw1q04ds2s_5eiiLPtoMmPzTPqgwoOiJV_ylSNKIni50OT.png)
And $\epsilon (l)$ Is **not **negligible. This just means the probability that **it wins **is more than negligibly above 1/2.
            - 
            - Explain the process of constructing a suitable adversary to prove that $\Pi_{PRG}$ (the encryption scheme using a pseudo-random generator) has indistinguishability in the presence of an eavesdropper **if **$G$ is a pseudo-random generator ‚Üì 
                - First, consider using **either **the pseudo-random generator to create input W **or** using truly random bits r. (Assume G is a pseudo-random generator)
                - Then ask the adversary to generate two messages $M_0$ and $M_1$ which we will randomly pick between to encrypt and send back. 
                - Encrypt our chosen message via: $M_b \oplus W$ and send it back to the adversary.  
                - If the adversary can distinguish between the two messages with a non-negligible probability, e.g.: $$\mathbb{P}(\text{PrivK}_{\mathcal{A}, \Pi}(l)=1)-\frac{1}{2} = \epsilon(l)$$
Then we've got output from a pseudo-random generator. 
                - For the case of random bits, we're essentially dealing with a one-time pad (as r is never seen by the adversary and is only used once) which is **perfectly secret**. So the probability of detection will be $\frac{1}{2}$.  
                - Note that this means $|P(D(r)=1) - P(D(G(K))=1|$ is equal to $|1/2 - (\epsilon(l) + 1/2)| = \epsilon(l)$ 
This is not negligible, so we contradict our initial assumption.

    - Security for multiple encryptions
        - The game for I.I.P.A (indistinguishability in the presence of an eavesdropper) uses the fact that the **adversary only sees the output of a key once,** the key is then regenerated. For real usages, keys will be reused.
        - ![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/ht5V1-IYYPelQK3KxtNYFulumFeX9uGbQW7EdzJ45D6xDUYRZimUuCSP62_XB04hiIPQ0Rxo0fKhTfX7Z0-ZUU9jlaea53HJe97CkgaJIPzL7TtFsdZ-jSi3RflI0xSW.png) 
        - Here the adversary plays the game $t$ times, and generates new pairs of messages each time.
        - We say an encryption scheme $\Pi$ has  __indistinguishable multiple encryption in the presence of an eavesdropper __ if:
![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/n7_IWQ5iKoNT6uTBbKPL-8OKJKLFapp6u3lfpLFPicWMW12faOa6o3HqdkcguBiWRIKiz6kT-GPeqeCPP0GUcX6KgZ8_OjaSzJWRGsa3Sf7VRZIa7CoKvpiclFpgStGT.png) 
        - Do stream ciphers exhibit  __indistinguishable multiple encryption in the presence of an eavesdropper? __ Why or why not‚ÜíNo, we can consider sending 4 messages - the first pair are both all 1s from which we can figure out the key. Then we can use that key to distinguish the next 2. 
Or even simpler, first send a pair of messages $M_1$ then send $M_1$and some other message $M_k$ - then if the ciphertext is different in the second pair we know we've received $M_k$. 
        - Note that any **deterministic **encryption scheme fails this property. 
        - To solve this we do:
![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/tGJbGmAst2DUmM3pFNKTJ2moCHib-TnnOpNlKlSoZ2bIrvZ6yTuXT_pcWI_GsKUZQQIQ4cSbZQxjRSmcTcQdeKxvdoDAfV4jY6vmfvB2NaOxdsPozXNHIUFNBgwue0OV.png) 
        - But there's a problem with maintaining a communication session using this - we don't have explicit access to its internal state.

        - The adversary can encrypt messages as it likes, before playing the normal game again.
If this is still secure, then the encryption scheme has  __indistinguishable multiple encryptions under a chosen-plaintext attack.__

It depends on the **key**. Each choice of the key leads to a different function $F_K$.

Our ciphertext is then the concatination of the random input, and the XOR of the keyed pseudo-random function with the message.
Then to decode it, we have our pseudo-random key already, and we can just look at the random input - we can then use those to decode M.

        - If our pseudo-random function is a true random function - the best that the adversary can do is keep asking for new oracle values and hope that one of the values they tested shows up in the the real test:

Also, you can't distinguish some random $F_K$ from a random permutation.
        - A  __strong pseudo-random __ permutation remains indistinguishable even with oracle access to the inverse. 
        - Can you tell a pseudo-random function and a pseudo-random permutation apart?‚ÜíNot in polynomial time - the chance of a repeated value when you've read $f(x)$ items is $2^{-n} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{2} (f(x) + 1)$

$$f:\{1,...,n\} \rightarrow \{1,...,n\}$$
There are $n^n$ such functions. This is because each number can be mapped to **any **of the n numbers in the range (including itself) - so we have $n\times n \times ... \times n$ options. It's like factorial but we can repeat our choices.

The multiplication with the 4x4 matrix is done on a binary Galois field - it's like addition but without the carry bits. Behaves the same as XOR.

        - An actual implementation would be very expensive, but you can build up a table from substituted bits to the output of the matrix multiplication. Then add up the 32 bit outputs for different bytes.
Possible because the Matrix multiplication is linear.
    - Modes of operation
        - The problem comes if you have a message longer than 128 bits. Furthermore, **these schemes are deterministic.** 
        - Electronic Code Book
            - Simplest mode of operation for block ciphers, cut the message into m $n$-bit blocks.  
![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/Oruo3P_iSX4q6zhZp1P_pvMnSkyEs5YtLxO_Y9TcTfapRfHew7rB0uwtMgSgHDSQ5exCWWIbK6QpcCT9MvHeYoLIF3MjInOMImtEjQKXJyoUGjwPSgNqENdrkfnJ4rVd.png)
            - This is a deterministic encryption scheme - **so it is not CPA **(chosen plaintext attack) **secure.** You should not learn anything about the plaintext **if the ciphertext is repeated.** 
                - If you spot a repeated ciphertext, this gives you information. (i.e. Russia sent message to invade before, we read that again at some point we know what's coming)
                - Plaintext blocks are not uniformly distributed, ASCII has half 0's.

We can recognise the background (all 0s)  - and we can tell non-background apart from background.
        - Randomised encryption
            - Any CPA secure algorithm must be randomised, encryption algorithm has access to an $r$-bit random value that is not predictable to the adversary. 
![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/MjMljpzns8K7dEazoed0RFcJJedzkAkxCEFo9S1zMp8WhxYt8XSTH3_sksZNwk-BCxjT2V2IWD8KXafGhanq1Ante7ThxuQcIQthOJTog4Ang8qgaR0NpBb37apCFuFI.png) 
            - Note that with randomised encryption, the ciphertext **will **be longer than the plaintext. 
We attach the random value to allow for decryption:

        - Cipher Block Chaining
            1. Pad the message $M$ and split it into $m$ $n$-bit blocks, to match the alphabet of the block cipher used. $M_1 || M_2||...||M_m= M||\text{padding}$ 
            2. Generate a random, unpredictable $n-$bit initial vector $C_0$. 
            3. Starting with $C_0$, XOR the previous ciphertext block into the planitext block before applying the block cipher $$C_i = E_K(M_i \oplus C_{i-1})$$ 
            4. Output the $(M+1) \times n$-bit cipher text 
$$C = C_0||C_1||...||C_m$$
The extra n bits is $C_0$

            - The input of the block cipher $E_K$ is now uniformly distributed 
            - How can we form more uniformly distributed bit-strings if we have one already?‚ÜíXOR a bit string with a uniformly distributed bit-string, and the result is uniformly distributed. 
            - After how many repeated encryption operations (of the same message) would we expect a repeat in Cipher Block Chaining?‚ÜíAfter $\sqrt{2^n} = 2^{\frac n 2}$ blocks have been encrypted with the same K - where n is the block size in bits. Due to the birthday paradox.
Remember, it's uniformly distributed.
            - How do you decrypt a cipher block chain?‚Üí$C_1$ is decrypted and XOR'd with C_0 to give $M_1$ - then $C_2$ is decrypted and XOR'd with C_1 to give $M_2$ and so on.

If $C_1$ has a bit wrong, the whole of $M_1$ will be wrong, and only a single bit in $M_2$ will be wrong 
        - Cipher Feedback Mode

What are the advantages of this cipher feedback mode over cipher block chaining? ‚Üì 
                1. The block-cipher step needed to derive $C_i$ can be performed before $M_i$ is known, so incoming plaintext bits can be encrypted and output immediately. Don't need to wait for another $n$-bit block to fill.  - **reduces latency.** 
                2. No padding of last block needed. The previous block will be the required length, and we just XOR with that.
        - Output Feedback Mode (Stream cipher)
            - Works thusly:
                1. Split the message into $m$ blocks - the last block can be shorter (no padding):$$M_1 || M_2 || ... || M_m = M$$
 
                2. Generate a unique $n$-bit initial vector $C_0$ 
                3. Start with $R_0 = C_0$, then iterate

(Use only the leftmost bits needed for the last block)
                4. Output the ciphertext $C = C_0 || C_1 || ... ||C_m$ 
            - Replace the key before creating $2^{\frac n 2}$ blocks. 
            - Counter Mode (CTR)
                - This is a stream cipher **with a counter**. Count up the number of blocks encrypted, then include that in the item

                - 
            - Advantages of output feedback mode
                - Allows fast random access
                - Both encryption and decryption can be parallelized
                - Low latency
                - No padding required
                - No risk of short cycles
            - Counter mode is generally preferred over CBC, CFB and OFB.

    - Malleability
        - What is a **malleable **encryption scheme?‚ÜíIf an adversary can modify the ciphertext and cause a predictable change to the message. 
If we can modify a ciphertext and flip a certain bit, we could flip control bits in encrypted messages.

        - Why would malleable encryption schemes not be chosen-ciphertext attack secure?‚ÜíWe're given a possible encrypted message $M_0$ - if our scheme is malleable, then we can flip a certain bit, decrypt that. Then do it again with a different bit, and see if only the expected parts have changed.
You can do this multiple times to make sure.

        - The **verification algorithm** maps a key, a message and a tag to an output of valid or invalid (a single bit). $$b := \text{Vrfy}_K(T, M)$$
Tells us if the tag was generated by someone who knows the key.

    - MAC security definition: existential unforgeability
        - The adversary is given access to $\text{Mac}_K( \cdot)$ - (but not the key itself)
They can get a load of tags, when they query the oracle with a load of messages.
Then we test if the adversary can generate a correct message, tag pair. **The message can't be one of the messages used to query the oracle.**
        - A MAC is  __existentially unforgeable under an adaptive chosen-message attack __ if there's a negligible probability of their forged Mac code being correct.
