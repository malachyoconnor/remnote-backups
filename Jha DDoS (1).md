    - It was part of the conspiracy that the defendant PARAS JHA and his co- conspirators would attempt to discover both known and previously undisclosed vulnerabilities that would allow them to surreptitiously attain administrative or high-level access to victim devices for the purpose of forcing the devices to participate in the Mirai botnet.
    - It was further a part of the conspiracy that the defendant PARAS JHA and his co-conspirators would scan the internet for vulnerable IoT devices and, without  authorization, attempt to gain administrative access to those devices through the use of  credentials that they were not authorized to employ. 
    - It was further part of the conspiracy that the defendant PARAS JHA and his co-conspirators would, without authorization, infect with Mirai the IoT devices they were able to access, which afforded the defendant PARAS JHA and his co-conspirators complete control over the devices, and hijack them to create the Mirai botnet.

    - It was further part of the conspiracy that the defendant PARAS JHA and his co-conspirators would rent access to their Mirai botnet, which enabled other criminals to use the botnet to conduct powerful DDOS attacks.  These attacks caused damage to the  targeted servers, and were large enough to cause incidental damage to many servers located in close logical proximity to the targeted server. In fact, one feature of Mirai was the ability to conduct attacks against entire ranges of IPs, meaning that a victimâ€™s entire network would be affected. This feature, in conjunction with the very large size of the Mirai botnet, rendered useless many methods that are used to mitigate DDOS attacks, meaning that the attacks were capable of causing more network disruption than would be experienced in  attacks by other DDOS services

    - In August 2016, while directing a DDOS attack against a U.S. company, defendant JHA contacted the company and demanded payment in exchange  for halting the attack

    - In August 2016, defendant PARAS JHA engaged in a feud with rival DDOS botnet operators, during which period JHA generated and sent fraudulent abuse complaints to hosting providers associated with the rival group.  JHA also  conspired to conduct DDOS attacks against Internet architecture associated  with this group. JHA further participated in a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijacking scheme in which JHA and co-conspirators fraudulently gained control over IP addresses that were in legitimate use by third parties.  JHA conducted these activities to consolidate and maximize the power of the Mirai
