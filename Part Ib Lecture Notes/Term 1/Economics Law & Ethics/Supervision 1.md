- **Exam Question 1** 
    - a.) ** Explain what economists mean by a lemons market. [150 words] **
        - A lemon market is a market where information on the products in asymmetric, and customers cannot differentiate the higher quality products from the lower quality. As sellers have a vested interest in selling their product for what its worth (they have the knowledge on its worth), and buyers are unwilling to risk buying at higher prices for fear of buying a 'lemon', this leads to sellers selling the low quality goods rather than selling the higher quality goods at a loss until only the low quality items are on the market at all.
    - b.) **What is the difference between hidden information and hidden action? Give examples of  each. [150 words] ** 
        - Hidden actions are actions taken by one side of an economic relationship that the other side cannot observe, while hidden information is information held by only one side of an economic relationship. For example when buying cars, the fact that you're a bad driver is hidden information, and making the decision to buy a safer car because you're a bad driver is a hidden action. Another example would be a worker deciding to slack off, this is a hidden action that can lead to a worse product - the employer has an incentive to associate a cost with this action, this could mean only paying the worker for good products or monitoring their work schedule.
    - c.)
        - a.)  **You form a trade association with several other anti-malware firms and promote a quality assurance mark, perhaps with assistance from the government. [200 words]** 
            - This signals to the user that your item is of high quality, as the government and . While this doesn't eliminate competition (as other firms also have this quality-assurance mark) it results in poor-quality providers who can provide a cheap enough service to allow for massive undercutting of price to be less favourable by customers. This means a greater share of customers land inside the quality-assurance holding group, resulting in a larger share of the profit. However the asymmetric knowledge of the user could **include** the existence of this mark, and they could end up buying the cheap product they see without knowing about the mark. Additionally, the validity of quality-assurance marks (especially for anti-malware programs) can be difficult to validate by the user, as illegitimate companies could produce their own mark to trick users. There's also the problem that you may be further legitimizing your competition, where alternatives with better products where the legitimacy was previously in doubt can now be chosen safely in place of your product. ^^Signal is good if cost high for low quality but low for high quality - to the point where lying about lemons is not profitable. Assumption being that ^^ 
        - b.)  **You approach the UK banks with a proposal that they certify your product for use along with their banking app products, in the sense that a customer using your  system will have exercised due diligence. [200 words]  ** 
            - This would likely be successful in making your product seem more trustworthy, as it is bundled with the air of legitimacy banks have but don't deserve. However, this would still have to combat lock-in, where people already with a malware protection service may be reticent to swap. Also, the price that would need to be paid to the banks to advertise your service would likely be very significant - and the firm would have to consider if the potential increase in customers is worth the outgoing cost. This method does have the advantage of using people propensity to go with the flow - if their banking app tells them to install a certain program, they simply go with it and not question if there are cheaper or better alternatives. ^^Assumption being that banks have technical knowhow to detect lemons, and lemons cannot trick the banks. This would then be a good signal. ^^ 
        - c.) ** You tell customers that if they are the victims of a scam that used malware on their  phone you will pay their legal bills. [200 words]** 
            - This gives the customer a signal that you are a efficient malware detection site, as a failure in your system becomes more expensive to you meaning you are incentivized to stop such failures (very similar to car warranty). However, this will come against the behavioural psychology problem that most people don't think they would fall for a scam or trick. Additionally, if a problem with your service is found and exploited by scammers you may end up having to pay for hundreds of users refunds while the bug is still in place - this means very robust bug-checking features must be in place. This method does have the benefit that it sounds good, but few customers will be able to use it - as a tiny percentage of scam victims are able to pursue any legal action (many scammers being overseas). However, when scam victims attempt to use this service and find there's no recourse - there could be public backlash against your firm. If a firm was truly certain of their product, perhaps they would advertise refunding scam victims (who are scammed through malware their service failed to detect) rather than paying for their legal bills. ^^Make assumptions and solve problem based off those assumptions, assume code is really bug free (obvs not realistic) - assume competitors code worse than yours, and assume claims do occur. Finally point out the drawbacks of your assumptions. Because hyper-rational customer would know few claims go to court, would know the signal is worthless.^^ 
- **Exam Question 2** 
    - a.)
        - ![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/fmDPF-dInQpQH71USeyACbGDBgB3nscLlH3JJzNT4er96vIhCtjR1TYQGylX4N1pvTc6Vt6Sr3_pZcqlcEMQgX1KadmjmFAHIMDqaEx9SY8cG9oGrHlHWDcwUI1pK1WI.png) 
        - b.) In case v>c, then it's always better to choose hawk (as you don't run the risk of getting 0) so must have case v<c:
If the utility of choosing hawk is the same of that of choosing doves, where hawks are chosen with some probability p, this will form an equilibrium.
        - c.) Set the initial conditions and calculate:
        - $$\frac{v-c}{2} \cdot p + v(1-p) = \frac{(1-p)v}{2}$$ 
        - $$\frac{vp}{2}-\frac{cp}{2}+\frac{v}{2}(1-p)=0$$ 
        - $$- \frac{cp}{2} + \frac{v}{2}=0 \implies p=\frac{v}{c}$$ 
    - b.) In real life encounters, the probability of death is 0 - if you strictly consider this (without replacing c with some other factor) then the optimal strategy will always to be aggressive (choose hawk) as you gain at least $\frac{v}{2}$ and don't stand to gain $0$.  
    - However, if you replace c with some embarrassment factor where the other aggressive user wins the argument then the game plays out the same way as the hawk and dove game. Depending on the probability of getting embarrassed (a function of how good you are at arguing and how embarrassed you get at losing) you will decide to be a hawk or a dove .
- **Exam Question 3**
    - a) **What are the first and second theorems of welfare economics? [200 words]** 
        - The first theorem states that market equilibrium is pareto optimal, that is there is no further way for anyone to be made better off without making anyone else worse off - further changes would negatively impact some players. 
        - The second theorem states that any pareto optimal allocation can be achieved by market forces provided preferences are convex. Preferences being convex means any line between two bundles on an indifference curve will be made up of points that are **weakly preferred** to the bundles on the indifference curve. So given some initial conditions, we can reach any pareto optimal allocation (whether that be communism, monarchy or anywhere in-between) can be reached using a market.
        - Both of these theorems behave under certain assumptions, such as:
            - Complete markets, everything is traded on the markets. 
            - No transaction costs on the market.
            - Perfect information with rational actors
            - All consumers and firms are price takers
    - (b) **Give three examples of ways in which markets can fail to reach competitive equilibrium  when the assumptions of the first theorem do not hold, discussing the implications for the  information goods and services industries in each case.** 
        - One assumption is that the markets are complete, that is everything can be sold on the market. Consider a country deciding that food should not be sold on the free market, this will result in farmers suddenly unable to make money resulting in a decrease in a supply (without a corresponding decrease in demand). A change to government funding will have to be put in place, resulting in a lack of competition as farmers will be given a set rate. The equivalent for information goods and services industries would be if information on users could no longer be sold, platforms like Facebook and Google would have a large chunk of their business model wiped out as selling information on users through real time bidding for targeted ads is a large part of their business models.
        - If the assumptions that actors in the market are rational with perfect information were not fulfilled (and generally they aren't), this could lead to people purchasing things with little to no utility - meaning people who actually require the item could suffer, and results in people having less money to spend on utility rich items - potentially leading to a decrease in price as the price people are willing to pay decreases, finally this could lead to a stagnation of growth in those industries as they have less money to expand. In relation to the tech industry, this could be people spending all their money on NFTs with incomplete information on their worth - leaving nothing to be spent on the items YouTube, Google and Facebook advertises to them.
        - If the assumption that consumers and firms are price takers isn't met, then firms may list items at a price too low where they cannot keep up with demand - while they struggle and battle with the initial throws of this supply and demand curve:     ![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/4rqcmEIjQt_7SHMQvvfC0rawX7bN5sS307ywCIuC9CtuiDA4SXZ6n-m_2m2tyJjY8jsZmnz5i4uL858ZndmTTYwcLCrjvqOMFW34IqhJP-2knWk6Nca6sixpTfBWWhHs.png)                                                                                           Until they reach the later stages, other firms will be met with a huge decrease in demand - leading to stagnation of growth. Contrarily, if consumers buy the more expensive items when cheaper alternatives exists, competitors will have to change their product or lower prices even further to appear palatable. In regards to the information technology industry, this would be the equivalent of word becoming free to win back users of google docs - or if github started charging for the service and people kept using it.
- Exercise 1:
    - a.) **  Suppose that we say that an allocation x is socially preferred to an allocation y only if  everyone prefers x to y. (This is sometimes called the Pareto ordering, since it is closely  related to the idea of Pareto efficiency.) What shortcoming does this have as a rule for  making social decisions? [100 words]   ** 
        - Everyone needs to be polled in order to make any small decision, so decision making will be slow and cumbersome. Additionally, If even one person disagrees, no matter how absurd their reason is the idea will be thrown out, and as almost all decisions are likely to have some level of disagreement very few decisions will be accepted. 
    - b.)** A Rawlsian welfare function counts only the welfare of the worst-off agent. The opposite of  the Rawlsian welfare function might be called the “Nietzschean” welfare function—a welfare  function that says the value of an allocation depends only on the welfare of the best-off  agent. What mathematical form would the Nietzschean welfare function take? [100 words]   ** 
        - $\max U_i$  
        - We select for the maximum utility of our population, and try and boost that. ^^Assume we're looking at the utility of a single good^^ 
    - c.) **Suppose that the utility possibilities set is a convex set and that consumers care only about  their own consumption. What kind of allocations represent welfare maxima of the  Nietzschean welfare function? [100 words]** 
        - At face value, improving the utility of the best off person seems to be giving them all the resources. However, then the surrounding agents will suffer and the world around the richest person will degrade. Additionally, due to the convexity of utility functions resources become less desirable the more you have of the resource - meaning more money means less to a rich person than to a poor one. Thus, while some effort must be spent further enriching the best off agent - some money must be spent to maintain their surrounding population so the best off agent needn't witness poverty or drive on broken roads. 
    - d.) ** The ability to set the voting agenda can often be a powerful asset. Assuming that social  preferences are decided by pair-wise majority voting and that the preferences given in the  table below hold, demonstrate this fact by producing a voting agenda that results in  allocation y winning. Find an agenda that has z as the winner. What property of the social  preferences is responsible for this agenda-setting power? [200 words]** 
        - ![](local:///home/mali/remnote/remnote-614c8a3b6997e6001643dfce/files/S1XX-5lu6CMf8Oex4OuNutrHIHl8lA_z2RtN62sSS1UOlyLVRJ7fXN8frGL6TGGjzsMr_YJbGNr_STTvSPBZZuGJtZJmTvClb6EsVz4a2kqikwXXrgbQSJqvtTl9RW_j.png) 
        - ^^Not sure if my understanding of voting agenda is correct^^
        - Obviously, without an agenda the entire vote is a three way tie. If we set the agenda to who wins out of y vs z, we have y winning - as we get to wins for y and one for z. If the agenda is x vs z, we have z winning out with 2 votes to 1. ^^Agenda means, first have a and b fight then have b and c fight^^ 
        - I believe it's the property that people vote for the candidate they actually want to win first, and the following results are murky - especially if given a choice of the top X candidates rather than ranking all candidates. Thus, if specific candidates are chosen the results can vary wildly as less strict rules hold for the last two options.
