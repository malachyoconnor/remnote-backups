    - Email accounts represent an enticing target for attackers, both for the information they contain and the root of trust they provide to other connected web services.
    - study a segment of targeted attackers known as “hack for hire” services to understand the playbook that attackers use to gain access to victim accounts.
    - It has long been understood that email accounts are the cornerstone upon which much of online identity is built
    - Whereas attackers operating at scale expect to extract small amounts of value from each of a large number of accounts, targeted attackers expect to extract large amounts of value from a small number of account
    - Since targeted attackers focus on specific email accounts, they can curate their attacks accordingly to be uniquely effective against those individ- uals. Moreover, since such attackers are unconcerned with scale, they can afford to be far nimbler in adapting to and evading the defenses used by a particular target. Indeed, targeted email attacks— including via spear-phishing and malware—have been implicated in a wide variety of high-profile data breaches against government, industry, NGOs and universities alike

    - These victims in turn were “honey pot” Gmail accounts, operated in coordination with Google, and allowed us to record key inter- actions with the victim as well as with other fabricated aspects of their online persona that we created
    - We confirm that such hack for hire services predominantly rely on social engineering via targeted phishing email messages, though one service attempted to deploy a remote access trojan
    - As a whole, however, we find that the commercialized account hijacking ecosystem is far from mature. Just five of the services we contacted delivered on their promise to attack our victim personas. The others declined, saying they could not cover Gmail, or were outright scams.
    - Victim verisimilitude. We created synthetic victims that appeared sufficiently real that the hacking services we hired would treat them no differently from other accounts that they are typically hired to hack into. • Account non-attributability. We took explicit steps to prevent attackers from learning our identities while we engaged with them as buyers, when they interacted with us as victims, and even if they successfully gained access to a victim email account. • Range of attacker options. We did not know a priori what methods the hacking services would use to gain access to victim email accounts. Since there are many possibilities, including brute-force password attacks, phishing attacks on the victim, and malware- based attacks on the victim’s computers, we created a sufficiently rich online presence to give attackers the opportunity to employ a variety of different approaches.
    -  For each victim, we created a unique web site to enhance the fidelity of their online identity. These sites also provided an opportunity for attackers to attempt to compromise the web server as a component of targeting the associated victim (server attacks did not take place

    - Associate Identity. In addition to the victim identity, we also cre- ated a unique identity of an associate to the victim such as a spouse or co-worker. The goal with creating an associate was to determine whether the hacking services would impersonate the associate when attacking the victim (and some did, as detailed in Section 3.2)
    - his script logged any activity that occurs within the account, such as sending or deleting email messages, changing account settings, and so on

    - Service reliability. Of the twenty-seven services engaged, ten re- fused to respond to our inquiries. Another twelve responded to our initial request, but the interactions did not lead to any attempt on the victim account. Of these twelve, nine refused up front to take the contract for various reasons, such as claiming that they no longer hacked Gmail accounts contrary to their contemporary advertisements. The remaining three appear to be pure scams (i.e., they were happy to take payment, but did not perform any service in return). One service provided a web-based interface for entering the target email address, which triggered an obviously fake progress bar followed by a request for payment
    - Finally, five of the services made clear attempts (some successful, some unsuccessful) to hack into eleven victim accounts. We focus on these services going forwards.
- Page 05
    - As a rule, we always paid the services, even when they requested additional money, and even when we strongly suspected that they might not be able to deliver when they asked for payment up front.5 Our goal was to ultimately discover what each service would actually do when paid.
    - There are two legal issues at hand in this study: unauthorized access and the terms of service for account creation and use. Obtain- ing unauthorized access to third-party email accounts is unlawful activity in most countries and in the United States is covered under 18 USC 1030, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Contract- ing for such services, as we did in this study, could constitute aiding and abetting or conspiracy if the access was, in fact, unauthorized.
    - We note that the ultimate “success” of these attacks is partially dependent on our experimental protocol: in some cases, we supplied 2FA SMS codes to phishing attacks or installed a provided executable, while in other cases, we avoided such actions to see if the attackers would adapt.
    - he associate lures tempted the user to click on an “image” for the victim’s associate (using the personal connec- tion as a sense of safety), while the Google, bank, and government lures conveyed a sense of urgency to induce a user to click on the link.

    - Only service A.1 was able to construct personal lures without requesting assistance from the buyer, find- ing the details from the victim persona’s website. The extent of personalization was limited, though, consisting either of mimicking the victim persona’s company or their associate’s personal email address. No additional branding was lifted from our web sites.
    - . All services but one used “combo” domain name squatting [ 14] with the keyword ’google’ in the URL, presumably to trick the victim into thinking that the URL was a real Google subdomain. Services A.2 and B.2 used the same fully qualified domain name for the phishing landing page, suggesting that they share a business relationship (i.e., they may both be value-added resellers for the same phishing page service). Long-lived, reused domains suggest that they are valuable and perhaps relatively costly to acquire
    - The redirection URLs seemed to be one-time use URLs, since we were not able to visit them after the attack executed and did not see repeat redirection URLs in any of the attacks.

    - Figure 4 shows an example page flow used by one hacking service. We always entered the Gmail credentials of the victim to see how the hacking attempt would progress. After collecting the password, all but one of the hacking services would redirect to a new screen which asked for the 2FA code that the victim had just received on their phone from Google. Six of the nine hacking attempts captured the password from the phishing page and then immediately tried to use it to login to the victim’s account (as verified with our Gmail access logging). Due to the similar behavior and speed at which these logins occurred, we believe that most of these services used an automated tool, similar to Evilginx [6], for this step.
    - Service B.2 was similar to service E.1, but when they were blocked by the 2FA challenge they switched to phishing messages that looked exactly like the messages from service A. Upon col- lecting the password and the 2FA code that was sent to the phone number for the victim, the service was able to login.
    - ervice D was the only service that attempted to hijack our victim account using malware. The attacker in this case sent just one email message to our victim persona—flagged as spam—that contained a link to a rar archive download (Gmail forbids executable attach- ments). The archive contained a sole executable file. We unpacked and ran the executable in an isolated environment, but to no effect. According to VirusTotal [ 32 ], it is a variant of TeamViewer (a com- mercial tool for remote system access) which would have enabled the attacker to hijack any existing web browsing sessions.

    - Once accessed, all but one of the services abused a portability feature in Google services (Takeout) to download our victim ac- count’s email content and then provided this parcel to our buyer persona. One advantage of this approach is that it acquires the contracted deliverable in one step, thus removing risks associated with subsequent credentials changes, improvements in defenses, or buyer repudiation.
    -  While in- tended for users, such capabilities also increase the ease with which a single account hijacking incident can expose all of a user’s data to attackers. Since our study, Google has added additional step-up verification on sensitive account actions
    -  Our findings suggest that the hack for hire market is quite niche, with few merchants providing hijacking capabilities beyond a handful of providers
    - all such login attempts from the three services in aggregate. Over a seven-month period from March 16 to October 15, 2018, Google identified 372 accounts targeted by services A, B, and E. Figure 5 shows a weekly breakdown of activity. On an average week, these services attacked 13 targets, peaking at 35 distinct accounts per week
    - Thus, we surmise that the targeted account hacking market is likely small when compared to other hacking markets, e.g., for malware distribution [11 ]. While the damage from these commercialized hacking services may be more potent, they are only attractive to attackers with particular needs.

    - n, all had pinned posts on forums where this option was available. Only service A paid for banner advertisements on all of these forums. Together, this suggests that the services are profitable enough to continue advertising via multiple outlets. 
    - In addition to this qualitative search, we received an email ad- vertisement from one of the services for upcoming changes to the service, which was sent to 44 other buyers as well (exposing their clientele’s email addresses). 
- Page 10
    -  At a high level, we find that the commercial account hijacking ecosystem is far from mature. When such attackers are successful, they can be potentially devastating to individuals. Yet, as an overall market it is not poised to cause widespread harm.
    - Services have inconsistent and poor customer service. For ex- ample, three of the services charged significantly higher prices than their advertised price, and two services changed their initial prices while they were executing the hack. Moreover, customer service is slow and inconsistent in their communication with the buyer, sometimes taking more than a day to respond.
    -  Attackers showed little initiative. Most attacks made no effort to gather information independently about their victims. Of the nine attempts, only services A.1 and A.2 discovered additional information about the victim on their web sites, such as the name of their associate. The others, including different contracts within service A, would not attempt hacking the account without explicitly requesting additional information from the buyer.
    - n contrast, studies on markets for CAPTCHA solving [21 ], Twit- ter spam [30 ], and Google phone verified accounts [28 ] show that those services are quick to respond, and stable in their services and pricing. 
    - Two-factor authentication creates friction. Even though phishing can still be successful with 2FA enabled, our results demonstrate that 2FA adds friction to attacks. Various services said that they could not hack into the account without the victim’s phone number, had to adapt to 2FA challenges by sending new phishing messages to bypass them, and one renegotiated their price (from $307 to $690) when they discovered that the account had 2FA protection. Based on these results, we recommend major providers encourage or require their user base to use a 2FA physical token
