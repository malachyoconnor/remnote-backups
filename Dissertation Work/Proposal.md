        - Deliverables vs Measurables - Add a deliverables section (current success criteria look like deliverables) measure success against currently deployed MQTT, mention Go profiling and Python profiling. PAHO MQTT in python
    - Evaluation metrics
        - Test on varying use cases, some messages end up as JSON

        - Testing power is v complicated, can't just look at DRAM - all this deep sleep junk going on
        - Diagram of lab setup
    - Timetable and milestones
        - Milestones are a combination of evaluations and deliverables
    - Resource declaration
        - Explain you will prototype components on whatever dev setup you have (big that up, mention github, usb backups) but run the testing on the 'lab' platform.
